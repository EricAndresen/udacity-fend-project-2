# Memory game

This is a simple memory card game implement in HTML5, CSS3, and pure ES6. There are no dependencies. CSS grid and Flexbox are used to define layout and CSS animations are used for all animations.

To play, click on two cards. If they match they will change to checkmarks if they do not they will flip back over. When all cards are matched the player wins. After 25 failed attempts the player loses. There is a three star rating system that increments down with the players failed attempts. 

## Code Conventions
